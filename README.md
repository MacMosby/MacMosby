Hi there, my name is Marc. 👋

💻 I am a Fullstack Web Developer trained at Le Wagon Berlin (batch #734).
📚 I am currently working on my first own project called "Lending Libs" (working title) where you can borrow books from your neighbourhood.
🎸 Check out gigmee.org to see the first web application that I built with my amazing team at Le Wagon project weeks.
📫 To reach out to me shoot me a message to marcrodenbusch@gmail.com, looking forward to hearing from you. 🤗
